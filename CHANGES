OpenDRC 1.01 March 15,2011

	Changes:
		1) The project was converted to be compileable in a second environment: 

				MS Windows XP/Cygwin - Compiled/linked with GNU's g++
		
		   as well as the original enviroment:

				MS Windows XP        - Compiled/linked with Borland's C++Builder

		   The Cygwin linux-like environment can be obtained from: 

				http://www.cygwin.com/

		2) The GNU g++ compiler flaged some code changes that more rigorously stick
		   to the C++ standard than my current Builder setup.  These changes include:

			a) Conversion of #include's to standard header names (from depreciated ones):

				<stdio.h>  ==>  <cstdio.h>

			   and 

			    <vector.h>  ==>  <vector>

			b) Testing int's against 0 instead of NULL.
			c) Missing casts "BYTE*" to "const char*" etc.
			d) Adding the namespace command:

				using namespace std;

			e) Using un-commented extra tokens on #endif lines.
			f) Conversion from using struct ffblk/findfirst/findnext to struct dirent/scandir.
			g) Translation between Borland mkdir() and GNUC mkdir().
			h) Changing "\\" in C-strings to "/".
			i) Added type to declaration of flag FLG_DatabaseLoaded in DRC_Main.cpp/Load_Database().
			j) Removed SED prefixing isatty() with std:: in compilation of FLEX sources.
			k) Corrected problem in DRCTest.cpp/SaveACTSTotals() with short lines and comments.
			l) In the MS Windows/Borland environment a file named "con.acts" cannot be created
			   but can be in MS Windows/Cygwin.  Fixed this so that "con" is never used as a 
			   filename without a con-# suffix.
			j) Converted over the batch files (AllWords, ARCNonWord, and Pseudohomophones) to 
			   use LF not CR-LF sequences to terminate lines.  This can be done with the
			   Cygwin command:

					tr -d '\r' <infile >outfile

			k) Corrected a bug in DRC_CmdLine.cpp/Set_SetParameter() that reported a change in
			   a boolean(true/false) parameter incorrectly.  In particular the OpenDRC command

				-P <parameter> <value> 

			   worked but displayed garbage in reporting the change.
